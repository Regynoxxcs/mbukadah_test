1. Fans & Blowers

Axial Fans – Moves air along the axis; used in ducts or open spaces.

Centrifugal (Radial) Fans – Moves air perpendicular to intake; used in HVAC systems.

Inline Duct Fans – Compact fans for boosting airflow in ductwork.

Exhaust Fans – Removes stale air, fumes, or moisture.

Ventilation Hoods & Fans – Used in kitchens, labs, or industrial settings.

Roof Ventilators / Roof Fans – Extracts hot air from buildings.

AAR Vent Fans – Typically used in rail or tunnel ventilation for air circulation.

2. Ducting & Accessories

Flexible Ducts – Easy-to-install ducts for HVAC.

Galvanized Steel Ducts – Standard rigid ductwork.

Aluminum or Stainless Steel Ducts – For corrosive environments.

Dampers – Control airflow in duct systems.

Diffusers & Grilles – Distribute air into rooms.

Louvers – Prevent backflow or control airflow at openings.

Transition Pieces & Elbows – Shape airflow paths.

3. Air Handling & Treatment

Air Handling Units (AHUs) – Centralized systems for moving and conditioning air.

Heat Recovery Ventilators (HRVs) – Recovers heat from exhaust air.

Energy Recovery Ventilators (ERVs) – Recovers both heat and moisture.

Filters (HEPA, Carbon, MERV) – Clean air from dust, smoke, and contaminants.

Humidifiers / Dehumidifiers – Control moisture in ventilation.

4. Industrial Ventilation Equipment

Fume Hoods – Laboratory or welding fume extraction.

Dust Collectors / Cyclones – Remove dust and particles from air.

Explosion-Proof Fans – Used in chemical or hazardous areas.

Jet Fans / Tunnel Ventilation Systems – For tunnels, mines, and underground parking.

5. Controls & Monitoring

VAV (Variable Air Volume) Boxes – Control airflow in zones.

Thermostats & Sensors – For temperature, humidity, and CO₂ monitoring.

Speed Controllers / VFDs (Variable Frequency Drives) – Regulate fan speed.

Pressure Switches & Gauges – Ensure proper airflow and safety.

6. Miscellaneous

Roof Curb & Mounting Kits – For fan installations.

Sound Attenuators / Silencers – Reduce noise from fans or ductwork.

Air Curtains – Prevent air mixing at entrances.

Vent Caps / Exhaust Hoods – Protect ducts from rain, debris, and animals.
